# Proxify

For those times when you all you need is a quick list of proxies. Proxies come
from [Free Proxy List](https://free-proxy-list.net/).

## Usage

Choose your provider (all come from free-proxy-list.net)

    default = https://free-proxy-list.net/
    us = https://www.us-proxy.org/
    uk = https://free-proxy-list.net/uk-proxy.html
    web = https://free-proxy-list.net/web-proxy.html
    anonymous = https://free-proxy-list.net/anonymous-proxy.html
    google = http://www.google-proxy.net/
    socks = https://www.socks-proxy.net/
    ssl = https://www.sslproxies.org/

Instantiate a new `Proxify` object with your desired provider

    $ list = Proxify::List.new(provider: :default)

Proxies are available by calling the proxies method

    $ list.proxies

There are convenience methods to filter proxies by type

    $ list.elite_proxies
    $ list.anonymous_proxies
